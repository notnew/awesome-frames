a emacs inspired layout for awesome window manager

Divides the workarea into 3 frames, which are like emacs windows.  Each frame may be associated with a client window to show in the frame.  Functions are provided to switch between frames and to pull windows unassociated windows into the current frame.

This is similar (though less flexible than) the layout used by stumpwm or emacs' windows and buffers.
